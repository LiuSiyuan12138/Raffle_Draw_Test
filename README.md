# Raffle_Draw_Test
We consider two main parties in a Weibo raffle game, including the launcher, who launch the draw, and the participants, who retweet or like the Weibo with the purpose to win the
raffle prize. Motivated by the recent controversial ’Sicong Wang’s Weibo Raffle’ event and the lack of research on such raffle draw activities, we are interested in the online raffle draw mechanism and conduct empirical study to tend to answer the following issues:

  • Whether the Weibo raffle filtering algorithm is fair to all the participants?
  
  • How to maximize the market influence of an online raffle draw activity ?
  
For the problem about fairness, we detect the raffle algorithm by conducting hypothesis tests and logistic regression to exam the relationship between prize winning probability and different properties of participants’ accounts. The result also provides us theoretical support to select variables in the later section. Furthermore, time-series analysis is conducted as supplements for explanation of linear regression. Results provide Weibo accounts engaged in raffle draw activities with useful insights: participants can better evaluate the activity and launchers can efficiently design the game to reach a win-win situation.
